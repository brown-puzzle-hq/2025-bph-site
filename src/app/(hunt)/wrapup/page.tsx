                  The guards sequence was originally a Thomas innovation&trade;
                  but this vision was quickly taken on by three of our new
                  authors, Jack, Nate, and Nicholas, known within the club as
                  the triplets (or later the guards). The idea was to spin off
                  the classic idea of distinguishing between a liar and a
                  truth-teller via strategic questions and logic, and these
                  puzzles would gatekeep each round. This quickly devolved into
                  a plethora of shenanigans: from Two Guards, Two Doors, we soon
                  increased the number of guards, doors, and other things!

                  Various guards puzzles spoofed the green-eyed riddle, the
                  Monty Hall problem, the wolf, goat, and cabbage problem, and
                  the double-slit experiment.

                  For M guards, N doors, and K choices, we ran the puzzle
                  in-person as a live game show! Our lovely guards, donned in
                  suits and fun hats, ran the show with a captive live audience
                  and their beloved doors.

                  The doors in question, for those of you wondering, were
                  Ukrainian dollhouse-sized doors purchased off of Etsy. They
                  were the pride and joy of our guards crew, who crowdsourced
                  the ~$80 from a team of door-aficionados within our club.

                  The day before the hunt, the three of them went to our

                  scratch—after many hours, it turned out wonderfully!

                  serendipitously found a way to contact THE Ben Doyle we jumped
                  on the opportunity. Even though we pitched a single video and
                  subsequently upped the ask to a whole sequence, Ben was super
                  willing to help us out. Huge shout out to Ben Doyle! We had
                  lots of fun writing Jet Lag-themed puzzles and it made our
                  weekly watch parties all the more exciting.

                <h2>A Fistful of Cards</h2>
                <p>
                  A Fistful of Cards arose as the result of Thomas coercing our
                  resident MtG expert into writing an MtG-inspired sequence.
                  These puzzles were lovingly crafted by both Thomas and Jeremy
                  over a rather short period of time in pursuit of getting the
                  cards ready to order. This sequence seems to have been a
                  frequent victim of backsolving, but it's worth a post-solve
                  for those who skipped over it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For those of you who didn't solve in-person or purchase a Box,
                  these cards were printed and packaged as real playing cards!
                  This was easily the most expensive and time-intensive physical
                  puzzle we coordinated this year, and it required a ton of work
                  from a ton of people in a very short period of time. If you
                  have your cards, treasure them! They've got lots of cool
                  student-made art and make a lovely keepsake.

                <h2>Peanuts</h2>
                <p>
                  The idea for a packing peanuts puzzle came from the
                  quintessential question: how can we justify the rental of a
                  popcorn machine with our club funding? The brilliant answer:
                  serve packing peanuts disguised as popcorn!
                </p>

                <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
                  <img

                  <img

                    alt=""
                  />
                </div>

                <p>
                  In-person, teams who approached the popcorn table at kickoff
                  were asked whether they'd like 'edible or inedible popcorn'.
                  Our lovely popcorn vendors Noah and Chloe sold most teams on
                  the inedible popcorn alongside their actual bag of popcorn,
                  which resulted in a batch of packing peanuts in a popcorn bag.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Teams who ordered a Box were also fortunate enough to get
                  their own batch of peanuts. As I'm sure you can imagine, these
                  were not the most fun to manufacture in bulk. We spent many a
                  night hunched over a garbage bag of packing peanuts stolen
                  from the GeoChem department. While painful to label 4100
                  packing peanuts, they did have their intended effect.

                <p>
                  This puzzle idea was borne out of a scheduling necessity. Due
                  to our greedy two-weekend strategy, we accidentally booked out
                  both weekends that CMU could feasibly run (oops). In the
                  interest of making sure that the majority of teams could do
                  both hunts, the two teams agreed to run CMU on Brown's
                  in-person weekend, freeing up the online audience for both
                  hunts.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This, of course, allowed for shenanigans. While walking to
                  wrap-up for the MIT Mystery Hunt, I (Thomas) cornered Ryan
                  Judge and pitched him the idea for this puzzle. I knew that
                  ambiguous clues were a doable proposition, as I had written
                  similar puzzles before. Over the course of the next few
                  months, we sat down together and came up with eight workable
                  clues for each of the letter pairs for our selected answers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the end, Ryan did the majority of the work for this puzzle,

                <h2>Blueno's Puzzle Box (in-person)</h2>
                <p>
                  This year, our only in-person exclusive physical puzzle ended
                  up being Blueno's Puzzle Box! Despite being named in reference
                  to Amy's Puzzle Box from Jet Lag: The Game, this magnificent
                  creation was a glorious mashup of Garfield and Greek mythology
                  theming. Our resident RISD students Phil and Kaz took up the
                  challenge of making us a puzzle box, and boy did they deliver.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The final product was a massive four-foot wooden cube with
                  puzzles on all faces. Teams were given free reign to explore
                  the box in hopes of figuring out all four faces, but little
                  did they know, there was someone inside the box messing with
                  their progress! It was tons of fun to gaslight teams into
                  thinking they left the puzzle in a state that they actually
                  did not.

                  After completing all four faces, teams who chanted "I Hate
                  Mondays" were rewarded with the answer.

                <h2>The Boxes</h2>
                <p>
                  Thomas says: The Box was an idea I vaguely floated at an
                  in-person meeting around late November and early December,
                  inspired by Peppermint Herrings' (very successful!) Advent
                  Hunt. Megan took my ramblings and proceeded to dedicate a
                  significantly large portion of her time into making it a
                  reality.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Once SAO had approved our idea, all that remained was to come
                  up with enough physical puzzles to actually justify the idea.
                  More physical puzzles had already been an explicit goal, but
                  the Box reinforced our desire to come up with many
                  interesting, distinct physical puzzles.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In hindsight, I think we could have done a little more work in
                  making sure that each of the puzzles in the Box required their
                  physicality. While each of the puzzles in the Box benefited
                  from being physical objects (either thematically, or by making
                  certain steps easier), we didn't have any objects which
                  absolutely could not be solved in a non-physical format. This
                  was a double-edged sword. It made remote accessibility much,
                  much easier; but it did limit the capabilities of the puzzles
                  themselves. Our low difficulty ceiling also limited the
                  complexity of physical manipulation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  However, making physical objects with hidden "aspects" that
                  cannot be discovered early is really, really hard. As a small
                  aside, hiding information is very difficult; you either need
                  to hide it behind a physical transformation (often a
                  destruction, like applying liquids, breaking it in half, or
                  setting it on fire), or require the application of a tool that
                  you yourself need to provide (such as a UV light or magnet).
                  The former is extremely difficult to construct at scale, and
                  the latter necessarily would be spoiled by the inclusion of
                  said tools in the Box. This is still something I'm puzzling
                  over, and if we decide to do Boxes next year, it will be
                  something we work harder on.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Megan says: The Boxes haunted my dreams for a significant part
                  of the semester. Figuring out how to make the remote solving
                  experience live up to all of the cool things we orchestrate
                  for in-person weekend is consistently a challenge, and in the
                  past some things have ultimately ended up fully inaccessible
                  due mostly to a lack of bandwidth to make perfectly remote
                  accessible versions. So, when Thomas pitched mailing puzzles
                  to people, I knew what I was signing up for but figured it
                  would be worth the effort in the end.
                </p>

                <p>
                  First, I had to make a desperate plea to the student
                  activities office to let us do something like this. Spending
                  our Brown-allotted funding on providing supplies for non-Brown
                  community members is mildly frowned upon, so we needed to
                  evenly split our purchases between raised funds and club
                  funding (easier said than done).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Once greenlit, we began brainstorming what sorts of things to
                  put into the Box. Puzzle design aside, we aimed to keep things
                  quite small / light from a shipping perspective. Turns out,
                  figuring out how to send an unknown amount of objects of an
                  unknown weight and unknown size is not the easiest thing to
                  calculate, so shipping was a big unknown for most of our
                  planning process. After many (MANY) spreadsheets and a few too
                  many questionable emails to supply manufacturers, we got
                  enough of a rough idea of what we wanted to put into the Box
                  that we were able to settle on a price. The goal was to get as
                  close as possible to charging exactly what we'd be paying for
                  the raw materials, but with a little extra wiggle room so as
                  not to inadvertently send our club into crippling debt. We
                  settled on $19, which I think is a pretty reasonable rate for
                  all of the things the Box contained. I'd say the highest value
                  items are certainly the cards, followed by the pin and
                  stickers. While as Thomas mentioned we got some feedback that
                  not everything in the Box necessarily needed to be a physical
                  puzzle, which is certainly true, I'd argue that the value from
                  a few items alone made it worth the price we charged for it.
                  For transparency, we ended up with a small amount of extra Box
                  profit due to conservative shipping estimates, so we spent it
                  on feeding ourselves during in-person weekend (which I'd say
                  is a worthy expense).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Knowing that we were going to ship Boxes put a pretty tight
                  timeline on all of the puzzles being written for it. Despite
                  my pleading, our club notoriously operates on a pretty
                  last-minute timeframe, so the necessity of having several
                  puzzles completely and irreversibly done was a new challenge.
                  Cards in particular had to be done super early, as there was a
                  significant turnaround time to get the nice poker cards and
                  instructions booklets designed and printed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Beyond just puzzle construction constraints, physical
                  manufacturing proved a beast. Those packing peanuts took years
                  off our lives, and many a late night was spent in
                  Page-Robinson hall with Box materials strewn about the floor.

                  It was a ton of work to put together, so while it certainly
                  had its flaws I think we ultimately did a cool and (somewhat
                  unique) thing! Who's to say whether we will attempt something
                  like this again in the future. It certainly had its merits but
                  also somewhat constrained our in-person physical puzzle
                  efforts and took up a lot of bandwidth for a very long time.
                  Despite its flaws (and likely missing / erroneous packing
                  peanuts), I hope everyone who got a Box can see all the time
                  and effort we put into each component.

              <h2>Hunt Structure</h2>
              <p>
                The overall structure of the hunt had two broad goals. Firstly,
                we wanted to experiment with writing smaller, somewhat-easier
                puzzles. Last year's hunt had mostly been about designing
                larger, more difficult puzzles; now we wanted to mess around on
                the other end of the spectrum.
              </p>

              <p>
                Secondly, we wanted to give people a sense of exploring physical
                space, through an adjacency unlock structure and a dedicated map
                screen. In practice, this did not happen very successfully.
                Experienced solvers often ended up ignoring the map function for
                the less pretty but more information-dense puzzle list; this had
                the downside of them getting stuck later in the hunt, when
                information from the map became useful. Many solvers did,
                however, use the map function throughout the hunt; those solvers
                enjoyed a slight competitive advantage towards the end.
              </p>

              <p>
                We were strongly aware that this might happen. However, the map
                was not quick enough on all devices for us to only present that
                option, and we were reasonably confident that our map-dependent
                puzzles would force all solvers to, at some point, see our cool
                art. And it was quite satisfying to watch very capable solvers
                collide face-first against their own assumption that certain
                aspects of the hunt would not be useful.
              </p>

              <p>
                From the first point grew an entirely different beast, which was
                our sequences! Sequences began as a way for puzzle-writers to
                demonstrate more flexibility, and explore more complicated
                puzzle ideas that would not fit into just one feeder.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our implementation of this was strongly inspired by the 2024
                Galactic Puzzlehunt. Indeed, our first pitch meeting for the
                hunt's structure was on the 22nd of September 2024, while GPH24
                was still running.
              </p>

              <p>
                From GPH24, we took these original ideas of easier overall
                difficulty and "linked" puzzles. However, one aspect of GPH24
                that we felt could be improved upon was the lack of connection
                between all the puzzles; the vast majority of puzzles in GPH24
                did not fall into a sequence, and thus felt broadly unconnected
                to the hunt. While this was successful for them due to their
                random unlock structure, user-submitted puzzles, and overall
                high polish, we were not convinced that it would be successful
                for our purposes. We also wanted to show off.
              </p>

              <TOCSection sectionId={3} tocTitle="Sequences" parentId={2}>
                <h3>Sequences</h3>
                <p>
                  The initial intent was actually not for there to be 12
                  sequences, and for the Horror round to entirely contain
                  sequence metapuzzles. While I (Thomas) was distinctly aware
                  that it could be a possibility, I did not necessarily want to
                  make any decisions that would lock us into doing it; for much
                  of the early part of the development process, our explicit aim
                  was to only have six or so sequence metapuzzles in the Horror
                  round. It was only around late January that it became clear to
                  me that 12 (as it was referred to in shorthand) was actually
                  possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The overall implementation strategy was simple. In October we
                  formed groups of writers to create our six "main" rounds:
                  Action, Drama, Comedy, Reality, Animation (later nicknamed
                  Digging, and finally named Adventure), and Cerebral (later
                  renamed Horror). These writers had the goal of sticking
                  closely to the overall movie theme, as well as the genre theme
                  of their choice. Overall, we felt that all of our round metas
                  were very successful; they felt thematically cohesive and
                  mechanically relevant to each of our rounds. We also wanted to
                  enforce high overall answer quality to allow for as much
                  sequence flexibility as possible; we (mostly) succeeded here
                  too.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After that, authors interested in writing sequences were free
                  to claim as many answers throughout the hunt as they desired,
                  as long as they claimed at least one answer in Horror as their
                  "meta". These metas were not necessarily required to use the
                  answers of the other puzzles in their sequence; they could
                  also use mechanics of previous puzzles, or simply act as a
                  thematic capstone that would be a satisfying "ending".
                </p>
                <p>
                  The idea of having 12 sequences got significant pushback
                  throughout the year. Standing concerns included the fact that
                  this might restrict puzzle authors too much, or limit our
                  puzzle diversity. According to our records, it was only on
                  January 20th that we fully decided to go for 12. Once we had
                  reached 8 or so, our hand was forced; it would not make sense
                  for so many of the Horror feeders to be sequence capstones if
                  the remaining ones were not.

                    November 17: answers released. 👁️ (initially named 🥕), 💂,
                    and ✈️ sequences immediately begin development. Heist (🏦)
                    begins development, but is not at this time planned to be a
                    sequence.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    November 19: 🃏 begins development. 🏦 is converted into a
                    sequence.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    January 19: ⛓️ begins development (although not necessarily
                    as a sequence at this time.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    January 21: Secret Ingredient and Opening Sequences are
                    converted into 🌲; Erin agrees to write the remaining
                    feeder. Imagine and Lost Lyric are converted into 💿, with
                    Thomas writing the meta, and Audrey agreeing to write the
                    remaining feeder. (At this time, Secret Ingredient is the
                    only Horror feeder to be finished.)
                  </li>
                  <li>February 6: Eye-to-Eye (the 👁️ meta) is finished.</li>
                  <li>
                    February 9: The first full draft of 🃏 is finished,
                    including A Fistful of Cards IV.

                    March 1: You’ve Got This Covered, Fractal Shanty, and
                    International Neighbours are absorbed into a new sequence,
                    🧩; Philip and Thomas write the meta, Fridge Magnets. (This
                    is broadly accepted to be the point of no return.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    March 2: ⭐ begins development. (At this time, both Walk of
                    Fame and What’s My Ride? had been finalized, but the final
                    feeder slot and the meta would not be finalized for some
                    time.) The first draft of the ⛓️ meta, Red Blue, is written.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    March 5: The first draft of the 💂 meta, The Guard and the
                    Door, is finished. It will not change significantly.

                  <li>
                    March 8: Hand Letters and Filming Schedule are converted
                    into ⏰, with Malcolm and Thomas writing the meta. The first
                    draft of the ⭐ meta, Constellation, is written. The first
                    draft of the 💿 meta, The Compact Disc, is also written. The
                    first draft of the ✈️ meta, currently called Color Transfer,
                    is also written, though it will later be significantly
                    redrafted.

                  As you can see, there was no plan. Sequences were written and
                  discarded throughout the year; several sequences which did not
                  make the cut have eluded mention. Some were assigned emojis
                  (such as 🔳 and ⚔️); others did not reach that stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was an explicit goal to have a mixture between sequence
                  metas which only used the puzzle answers, sequence metas which
                  used the answers and some aspects of previous mechanics, and
                  sequence metas which only relied on previous mechanics (and
                  not the answers); I feel that we had a fairly good mix of
                  these.

                  Would we attempt this structure again? Probably not. We're
                  glad we did it, and it was a lot of fun, but it was also a lot
                  of work, and caused Untold Pain and Suffering. However, the
                  structure was also very well received by the community, and
                  we're glad that everyone enjoyed it! We certainly felt that it
                  was worth the work we put into it.

                  Arnav says: I'm super glad we tried both the adjacency
                  structure and the guard bottlenecks—they were cute ideas and
                  quite compelling. In retrospect, I think both were unideal.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I believe that it should be exceedingly clear to teams whether
                  solving a puzzle will make overall progress in the hunt. For
                  example, solving a puzzle in an early round of a hunt will not
                  unlock anything or will not mean as much a later-round solve.
                  With the adjacency structure, puzzles have vastly different
                  weights in how important they are to be solved, and even if
                  the map provided some clue as to how the adjacency worked, it
                  may not have been enough.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The guards bottleneck, while extremely motivated, was still
                  not completely justified in my opinion—locking every round
                  behind the same flavor of puzzle, even as we tried to make
                  them varied in difficulty and content, can just ruin a
                  hunter's experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Thomas says: In hindsight, we should have made the map UI more
                  versatile, in order to encourage its use (and to increase the
                  information density of the map). Many solvers did not realize
                  that the unlock structure was adjacency-based until after the
                  hunt was over; this was a failure mode. I am certainly still
                  interested in exploring adjacency unlock structures, and if we
                  decide to attempt it again next year, we definitely will take
                  some of our learnings.
                </p>

                <p>
                  However, I will say that I still think solving puzzles in this
                  hunt was rewarding, even if they do not immediately unlock new
                  puzzles. In particular, our sequence meta structure places
                  emphasis on rewarding solvers who solve and understand feeders
                  from previous rounds, because those answers and mechanics can
                  become useful again. We heard stories of solvers returning to
                  forward-solve puzzles which they had previously backsolved in
                  order to try and solve the meta. I count this as a success!
                </p>

                <p>
                  However, I agree that there were "invisible bottlenecks" that
                  could end up frustrating. The guards were not the only one of
                  these; I believe Financial Crimes also was a "hidden"
                  bottleneck linking Reality, Adventure, and the back end of
                  Horror together. Ideally this latter case would not exist, but
                  it slipped our notice until the hunt had already started (in
                  which case we did not want to change anything, in case it
                  broke unlock progression for solvers).
                </p>

                <p>
                  But the guards thing was funny, Your Honor. The defense rests.

                <p>
                  This was an early innovation, pitched some time in
                  mid-September. The idea was to separate two very different
                  kinds of resource consumption; the in-person hunt, which
                  requires innumerable person-hours, team check-ins, classroom
                  space, props, and live performance; and remote hunt, which
                  requires greater website infrastructure, and hinting (which
                  can be done remotely).
                </p>

                <p>
                  This was very successful, and we're probably going to do it
                  next year as well. It also convinced us that our hunt was more
                  or less Good before we released it to the Online Hunt
                  Community, which is always a scary proposition.

                <i>Words by Arnav Singhal</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                Firstly, and most importantly, huge thanks to MIT Puzzle Club
                and NES for testsolving our hunt. They provided a lot of very
                helpful feedback that made our puzzles and the overall hunt
                experience much better. NES in particular gave pretty detailed
                feedback on every single puzzle (at least, those that were
                written by that point).
              </p>

              <p>
                A unique property of university hunts is that they operate on a
                fixed schedule, for better or for worse. My personal preference
                is to take the time necessary to give each puzzle a couple of
                testsolves and clean post-prodding, but I (Arnav) have also seen
                this deadline-flexible approach lead to dead hunts. With our
                hunt being annual, this was not a concern.
              </p>

              <p>
                This, in addition to our large structure, meant that my main
                goal was to have each puzzle cleanly tested at least once,
                rather than the perfection I would prefer. Depending on how you
                count, only 5-6 of our 57 (??) puzzles did not have this clean
                testsolve, and 2 of them (having been written the night before
                hunt) did not get a twice-over by me. While these numbers are
                definitely unideal, none of these puzzles ended up being the
                problem points, and I'm not too dissatisfied with the overall
                process.
              </p>

              <p>
                One interesting challenge was that, as a result of much of our
                hunt writing team graduating last year, many of our puzzle
                writers were new to puzzles. I personally found this great, as
                this made testing from the beginner-solver perspective a lot
                easier, and Brown students who are new to puzzles are exactly
                our target audience. However, we did still want a polished hunt
                for experienced teams, and didn't have a lot of personnel
                capable of testing with that background (and those who could
                were often busy doing other things).
              </p>

              <p>
                This is where our external testsolves saved us—MIT saw a mix of
                finished and early versions of puzzles and clarified what ideas
                would and wouldn't work, especially for physical puzzles. NES
                got to see our hunt after another week of progress, which was
                much closer to the real deal. Both teams found a lot of
                inelegancies and inconveniences that got fixed afterwards. (You
                have NES to thank for the white boxes in the middle of rooms and
                the sound effects in the final Heist puzzle, among other
                things!)
              </p>

              <p>
                One point of improvement could definitely be scheduling. We had
                initially scheduled the external testsolves for the weekend of
                March 8 and March 15, with remote testsolve occurring first, but
                due to some conflicts, we had to switch these weekends, despite
                already having scheduled NES for the March 8 weekend. NES
                graciously agreed to switch, but even then, our hunt was not
                nearly in the shape I would have liked for either testsolve. The
                awkward timing of spring break and other Brown University events
                didn't leave much room for wiggling, but I think we will
                definitely consider having a remote testsolve occur during our
                spring break.

              <TOCSection sectionId={0} tocTitle="Map" parentId={1}>
                <p>
                  The map was a running joke/constant source of anxiety because
                  it was the largest art piece I personally have ever attempted
                  and also integral to the hunt structure. We decided that we
                  would have six movies corresponding to six studio lots that
                  led to each other via a map. To get to other lots, solvers
                  would have to go through a toll-booth where they would solve a
                  Guards puzzle.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The tricky thing about the map was that it also had to be a
                  pseudo-Brown campus replica and isometric. I also imposed the
                  stipulation that each section would be completed in a
                  different art style. Comedy was colored pencil, Action was
                  vaguely comic book style, Horror was Junji Ito inspired, Drama
                  was oil paint, Digging was watercolor, and Reality was boring
                  (boooo).
                </p>

                <p>
                  The other difficult thing about the map was that I had to work
                  on all of them separately and fit them back together, so
                  making a very detailed under-drawing was integral to the
                  process. The entire under-drawing was completed over Spring
                  break. Then the following week was
                  skip-all-homework-and-illustrate-in-the-ERC week. Despite the
                  aforementioned skipping of classes and homework, I still had
                  two more sections of the map to illustrate the night before
                  the hunt, which meant staying up until 6:30 am the day of the
                  hunt to finish. Never again. But, it looked pretty cool so
                  it's whatever.

                  Since we were making a map, we also needed a lot of sprites!
                  Upwards of 50 puzzles meant upwards of 50 unique sprites
                  corresponding to the content of these puzzles. The art team
                  was on the smaller side and Chloe J, Chloe Q, Phil, and Jackie
                  made most of these sprites. They are crazy talented and if you
                  haven't paid close attention, go back and look at them because
                  they are seriously beautiful. Also, huge shoutout to Chloe Q
                  for making the art for the sidebars, it adds so much life to
                  the website and works great thematically.

                  The other super fun experience from this year's art was the
                  cards. Chloe J and Jackie did most of the illustrations and I
                  did the layout/designs on Adobe Illustrator, my mortal enemy.
                  We also made a booklet and a playmat to go with them (Thank
                  you Megan and Arnav!) It was an extraordinarily gratifying
                  experience to see all our hard work come to life with the
                  physical playing cards and I hope every solver appreciated how

                of artists, which is largely because of how kind, talented, and
                fun the art team was to work with. I look forward to working

                In case you missed it, BPH25 was themed around movies! The
                original six rounds we decided on were action, animation,
                cerebral, comedy, drama, and reality. Cerebral got renamed to
                horror, and animation... Well, the team assigned to write the
                animation meta ended up writing a meta about digging, so this
                became the digging round! (renamed to adventure :( )

                During the hunt, solvers unlocked two interactions. After
                completing the action round, a production team member would go
                around and hand gold stars and pins to solvers. Sometimes this
                was more difficult than we had expected. Highlights include
                almost getting stuck in the Brown bookstore elevator? After
                unlocking the horror round, someone at HQ would call a team,
                impersonating Blueno and leaving an angry message. (Making
                Blueno the villain for the 3rd consecutive year? Oops.)
                Different HQ members had vastly different interpretations of
                Blueno (personal favorites include Noah's and Malcolm's).

                Runaround!!! We had 10 in-person teams complete runaround
                (yay!). Teams had to add finishing touches to the movies by
                completing a series of tasks in 30 (or fewer, depending on team
                size) minutes. These tasks included dubbing over a scene,
                swinging a sword at someone while they read the words to the
                FitnessGramTM Pacer Test, (NOT!!!) making a coffee order by
                pouring lemonade into a bucket (sorry Erin), running down Thayer
                street to take selfies with murals (should've asked teams to
                send us their pictures, oopsies), and solving a 2x2 Rubik's cube
                while blindfolded. After finishing runaround, you watched the
                movie premieres (most of which was also put together the night
                before the hunt)! Pictures pictures pictures.

              <p>
                Events were overall a blast!! Since I spent launch-delay and all
                of the morning on tech (instead of preparing the events as was
                originally planned), the first event (Auditioning for a Role)
                was not finalized until, well, during the event. (Unfortunately,
                the events team was a three-person team, and two of those people
                (Megan & Erin) had many other roles during the hunt, so it was
                mostly on me (Jack) to run it all.) This, as well as us
                underestimating how long it would take to run each audition, led
                to most teams having to wait longer than expected for their turn
                (sincere apologies for that).
              </p>

              <p>
                Lessons were definitely learned, but most teams said they
                enjoyed the event overall, and the final products were very
                entertaining to watch. Thankfully, the other two events were
                much more straightforward to run and were prepared well in
                advance. Poster Pastiche had a massive turnout and was
                incredibly successful, and Sneaking a Screening was a
                hilariously fun way to round out Saturday night.

                  This event involved 4-5 interns getting different scripts
                  (referencing the different rounds of the hunt: action, drama,
                  reality, adventure, and comedy) and one by one going into a
                  room alone with the director. Each script had a "restriction":
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    the action script had to be read in a manner where the two
                    characters were distinct in personality/mannerisms
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the drama script had to be read a language other than
                    English
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the comedy script had action words (like “jump” or “dance”)
                    that had to be acted out physically
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the adventure script had blanks that had to be filled in
                    based on Brown lore
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the reality script (nature documentary themed) had to be
                    read in a British/David Attenborough-type voice
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  ...and the director subtly hinted to the interns what they had
                  to do (by yelling at them and kicking them out of the room).
                  This repeated, with the scripts also rotating between the
                  interns (making them have to confer on restrictions) until the
                  director deemed that someone had "landed the role", after
                  which that script was theirs and they would wait until
                  everyone else had landed their roles.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Once everyone had landed their roles, their last task was to
                  read a "meta" script (themed in horror) that involved all 4-5
                  parts and their respective restrictions, the last line which
                  was the answer!

                  This event involved 6 teams of ~8 interns each with over 50
                  participants overall. Each team was given one of the six
                  canonical posters (below), which were clear parodies of
                  real-life movies...

                  ...and had 20 minutes to make a set of 10 instructions,
                  written on index cards of 2 instructions each, of how to
                  recreate the posters. Each team also had restrictions in
                  writing the instructions: besides not being able to reference
                  the movie name or the real-life movie, they also:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>“Excellentman” (Action): could not use adjectives</li>
                  <li>
                    “Biliogy of an Autumn” (Reality): could only use
                    one-syllable words
                  </li>
                  <li>“A Partial Known” (Drama): could only write in haikus</li>
                  <li>
                    “French General TNT” (Comedy): could not reference cliors
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    “North Dakota Williams and the Unfinished Script”
                    (Adventure): no restriction
                  </li>
                  <li>“Yell” (Horror): could not use body parts</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Once the instructions were written, we took the posters back
                  and gave blank sheets of paper to each group and then passed
                  out instruction cards to each group. Each group got 5 minutes
                  to draw with the materials they had (which were different
                  between tables: crayons, colored pencils, markers, etc.), and
                  then we passed the posters clockwise and gave the next set of
                  instructions to each group. Finally, we swapped the last two
                  sets of instructions (teams got instructions 9-10 before 7-8)
                  which was a bit of a twist, and then we handed the original
                  posters and the finished Frankenstein posters to the groups
                  who originally made the instructions. These were the very
                  impressive final products!

                  The final event was arguably the most fun (for both the
                  interns and the organizers)! This event involved teams of 6-8
                  interns (who were told to bring layers) hiding a bunch of
                  random, dollar-tree-bought items, taking a long, complicated
                  walk through the Barus & Holley basement to arrive at a movie
                  theater (the room right next door), and having to produce all
                  of the items in the same condition as before. Some items were
                  deliberately challenging, such as two pool noodles, a fully
                  inflated beach ball, a brick, and a completed, very brittle
                  100-piece puzzle. If all of that weren't enough, the interns
                  needed tickets to enter, but there was one less ticket than
                  the number of people, so they had to figure out a way to sneak
                  another person past the security guard (Veronika) at the door.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This event was an opportunity for interns to be really
                  creative; some excuses/techniques were saying the last person
                  was a body pillow or a dead body, the beach-balls were
                  pregnancies or a cyst, the pool noodles were crutches for a
                  dementia-ridden grandpa, and yelling at (and subsequently
                  seducing) the security guard while the rest of the team was
                  rushing to put together the 100-piece puzzle after so
                  confidently crumbling it.

                Brown Puzzlehunt is a beast of an event to plan. We took on a
                lot of ambitious logistical challenges this year, from running
                two weekends to Boxes to a full-steam-ahead timeline. It takes
                someone slightly insane to keep on top of all of the many things
                going on with our event at any given time and fortunately we
                have that delusion in abundance.

                We booked on-campus rooms last November, and ended up occupying
                around 30 rooms across several buildings during our in-person
                weekend. It took consistent cooperation with the Student
                Activities Office, Undergraduate Finance Board, and scheduling
                office to make this event happen, and we're incredibly grateful
                for their cooperation in our shenanigans. Huge shoutout to our
                SAO advisor, Malcom Moniz, for all of their help in helping us
                pull this together!

              <p>
                Our hunt writing team went through a huge transition this year!
                A lot of our founding leadership graduated last May, leaving
                behind some large shoes to fill. While the alums did their best,
                that kind of transition inevitably results in some amount of
                knowledge loss, so we took this opportunity to rethink our
                leadership structures and club dynamics. We have a lot of
                amazing student leaders who have stepped up and taken on the
                challenge of pushing this event to the next level, and we're so
                proud of how things turned out in the end. Many of the main
                branches of our hunt were run by newbies this year, so we've
                learned a lot and are excited to keep momentum rolling for next
                year.
              </p>

              <p>
                We had a lot of first-time puzzle writers on our team this year
                which was awesome! Most of them wrote their first puzzles either
                for puzzlethon or BPH, and it's been lovely to see so many
                students across class years getting involved in puzzles. We
                ended up with ~25 puzzle writers in total, which is a pretty
                hefty squad for a college hunt. Having such a large team with so
                much enthusiasm for what we've doing keeps us hopeful for the
                future of Brown Puzzlehunt.
              </p>

              <p>
                While we've learned a lot from this year, we ultimately feel
                that we made a pretty awesome final product that represents the
                culmination of months and months of hard work and creativity.
                While our team has perhaps not gotten as much sleep as would be
                ideal in the last few weeks, it was a good run and we're
                optimistic about what's to come for next year :)

              <p>
                We made a completely new site this year! We started building the
                tech stack (bph-site) last September and tested it with
                Puzzlethon last November. This semester, we focused mainly on
                extending the hinting and event systems, adding UI improvements,
                and making the map. No one on the tech team had web development
                experience at the beginning of the year, so we're really happy
                that we ended up with a functional site that (most) teams
                enjoyed.
              </p>

              <p>
                Both the backend and frontend are in TypeScript, and the UI
                components were made using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn. All of our
                infrastructure runs serverlessly on Vercel. We have a Postgres
                database on Neon and use Resend for emails. We chose a
                fully-managed solution because we were reasonably confident it
                would scale well during the hunt. (Struggles with scaling last
                year were part of our motivation to remake the site.)

                  Parallax alone was already quite complex. Add on mobile
                  friendliness and moving spotlights and you get a recipe for
                  pain and suffering. We went through three or so libraries, all
                  of which had issues (from weird scroll behavior to poor mobile
                  friendliness). We eventually settled on a Framer Motion
                  solution with sizing based on Tailwind math.

                  For images to adapt nicely between skinny phones and wide
                  computer screens, size had to be computed as a minimum or

                <h2>Map</h2>

                <p>
                  Map was probably the most frustrating component for art, tech,
                  and solvers. We originally used the Leaflet library which
                  provided many convenient features but was very laggy
                  (especially when zooming). Leaflet performs best for tile maps
                  with few markers since markers must be re-rendered every
                  frame. We tried several methods for improving efficiency to no
                  avail. The night before the in-person event, we decided to
                  switch to PixiJS. Oops. This decision led to a wonderful 9 AM
                  (and by 9 AM, we mean going to bed at 9 AM, not waking up at 9
                  AM). Unfortunately, PixiJS uses a different coordinate system
                  than Leaflet, so sprites were rotated 90&deg; about the map
                  origin. This required us to manually reposition every sprite
                  (sorry, Jack) and push back the hunt start time.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We made several QOL improvements to the map throughout the
                  hunt and into remote week. Unfortunately, most changes were
                  added after the bulk of the activity, so map use remained
                  relatively limited compared to the puzzle table.

                <h2> Postprodding</h2>
                <p>
                  The tech team did relatively little postprodding during the
                  hunt. Near the end of March, we wrote a short README on
                  editing the site, gave it to the technical-but-not-tech
                  puzzle-writing staff, and had them commit to branches. They
                  did an amazing job! In the end, over half of the 57 puzzles
                  were postprodded by puzzle writers. Since there were only two
                  people focused primarily on tech and many, many small tweaks
                  to puzzles leading up to the hunt, this worked out well. It
                  gave us time to polish the UI for the map and interactive
                  guards puzzles. (Shoutout to Arnav for postprodding and
                  finalizing the other puzzles.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  We made certain decisions to simplify the postprodding
                  process. First, we prioritized collocation. If you're editing
                  a static puzzle, everything you care about should be in the
                  puzzle's data.tsx file: the inPersonBody, remoteBody,
                  remoteBoxBody, solutionBody, authors, copyText,
                  partialSolutions, and tasks. Images, audio clips, and videos
                  also belong in that puzzle's folder. This meant that
                  postprodders didn't need to deal with the complexity of the
                  rest of the site. In addition, we focused on keeping things
                  isolated. With Tailwind, CSS classes are placed directly in
                  the markup so that changes don't impact multiple files.

              <TOCSection sectionId={0} tocTitle="Hunt Flexibility">
                <h2>Hunt Flexibility</h2>

                <p>
                  Another consideration was flexibility. We wanted to be able to
                  tweak how the hunt worked at a moment's notice without having
                  to change a bajillion files.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We achieved that by putting fewer things in the database. In
                  our old fork of gph-site, the puzzle table had fields for
                  name, slug, answer, body_template, round, order, is_meta,
                  emoji, unlock_hours, unlock_global, and unlock_local. In
                  bph-site, we only included the name, slug, and answer. The
                  rest of the information was hard-coded into the site.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Instead of having a body_template field, we chose to have a
                  different puzzle folder for every puzzle. Most static puzzles
                  stuck with the DefaultPuzzlePage component, which
                  automatically handled errata, puzzle body, guesses, partial
                  solutions, and tasks. Some interactive puzzles had custom
                  logic.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The flexibility made it easy to modify our structure for
                  puzzle unlocks, metas, rounds, and sequences—and to add new
                  categories like PUZZLES_WITH_INFINITE_GUESSES in the middle of
                  the hunt. It was also preferable for us that we could test
                  these changes locally before committing them to the production
                  branch, rather than directly making changes on the production
                  database.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This was also a little more dangerous. We had to be absolutely
                  certain that we were (1) listing valid puzzle ids and (2) not
                  forgetting any puzzle ids in the database. (One mistake in our
                  hunt.config.ts rendered the admin graph unusable for an hour.)
                  This is one benefit of tables over our structure: automatic
                  foreign-key validation.

                <p>
                  Because of the serverless nature of the site, we did not have
                  websockets this year. We instead kept the site responsive
                  using hooks and optimistic updates. We're still interested in
                  adding a dedicated server for websockets next year.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Websockets are a common pain-point during online hunts, and we
                  didn't have any, so— fortunately, the site never went down
                  during the hunt. There were a few notable bugs that affected
                  some teams:
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of the remote teams, yukii, caught that puzzle answers
                  were leaked in the source code. This was because we
                  accidentally made one of the server components into a client
                  component after the in-person hunt. We patched that around an
                  hour into the hunt. This is still a vulnerability in some of
                  our interactive puzzles, so looking at source code is not the
                  intended solution. We should have put more constraints on our
                  databases. Many race condition bugs came out of creating the
                  solves and events table this semester. Before we reverted the
                  issue, 1 team used an answer token on a meta puzzle, 1 team
                  submitted and used an answer token twice, and 3 teams
                  (temporarily) had an extra solve on the leaderboard. The map
                  took a lot of memory. We were already concerned about this,
                  and eventually decided to remove the map from the mobile
                  puzzle page during the in-person hunt.

                <p>Warning: gushing about tables and graphs.</p>

                <p>
                  Most puzzlehunt sites use Django, and Django has an automatic
                  admin interface. This is very convenient, but we don't regret
                  stepping away from Django and creating our own admin tools.
                </p>

                <p>
                  First was keeping track of a team's progress. Because of the
                  adjacency graph unlock structure, it seemed natural to also
                  just model this with a graph. We'll have to change this if we
                  use DEEP or a different unlock structure in the future, but
                  this was personally very fun to make!

                <p>
                  We also implemented improved data tables. We let admins edit
                  the role and interaction mode directly in the team table.
                  (This feature was not necessary at all, and toggling the roles
                  was so addictive I accidentally did it on the production
                  database once. Sorry to the affected teams!)
                </p>

                <img
                  className="rounded-md"
                  src="/wrapup/images/image76.png"
                  alt=""
                />

                <p>
                  Finally, we found that the most convenient way to keep track
                  of the hunt was still having a Discord channel to ping people
                  about registration, answer submission, solves, hint requests,
                  and interactions. For dev reasons, we also recommend sending a
                  Discord message if the catch block in a try/catch statement
                  gets triggered—it's great for catching early errors.
