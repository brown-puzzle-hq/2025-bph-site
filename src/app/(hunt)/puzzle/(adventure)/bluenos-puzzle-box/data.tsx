      For in-person teams, this was an interaction! Teams were brought to solve Blueno's Puzzle 
      Box, a puzzle box that turned out to be much larger than most solvers expected. After solving 
      the puzzle on each vertical of the box, teams had to chant "I Hate Mondays" to receive their final 
      riddle, and find out the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, unbeknownst to solvers, there is a creature inside the box. The creature, crafty in its ways, 
      likes to interfere with solvers, and sneakily undoes their progress when they're not looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find out more information at wrapup!

      For remote teams, they were instead served a delicious Jet Lag puzzle. Each of the six images on the cube 
      net are from specific episodes of Jet Lag: The Game, with either one or two characters obscured by the 
      red circle.
    </p>

      The six images are from the following episodes:

      Time to extract! If we write each of these characters on the faces of a cube net, 
      fold the cube net up, and then unfold it again (so the marked face is in the same 
      position and orientation), then the other characters are all rearranged. Helpfully, 
      they are now positioned so we can read them (in their new orientations) as letters; 
      reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom spells out the answer, 
      <span className="font-bold text-main-accent">WRECKING</span>.
