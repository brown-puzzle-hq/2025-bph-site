      The Heist sequence is a set of Sokoban puzzles, where placing any objects
      on all of the buttons of a certain color or shining a laser of the certain
      color into its corresponding laser will open the door of that color.
      Mirrors reflect lasers as shown, and boxes can block lasers. Touching a
      laser will cause the robber to die, forcing a restart.

      For The Final Heist, the player goes in blind, unable to see anything
      other than the white square in the center of every room. In order to
      figure out layout, they use the given room layout of BLIND to reconstruct
      the rooms from the feeders. The answers to previous feeders are their
      floor plans, meaning that each room in a given level is assigned a letter,
      so that reading the rooms in reading order spells the feeder answer for
      each round.

    <div>
      Placing the rooms to spell BLIND in the given layout gives the following
      overall map:

        the green laser.

        Move to the room to the left and move the mirror in this room on one of
        the red tiles in the next room to the left.
      </li>
      <li>Place the block on the grey tile on the other red tile.</li>
      <li>
        Move down and collect all three blocks and the mirror, bringing them
        back up past the red door.

      <li>
        Place one block on the grey tile and another block in the grey doorway.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line up all of other three blocks and two mirrors behind the blocking
        block and push them all through the grey doorway.
      </li>
      <li>
        Move a block in front of the purple laser, towards the top of the room,
        but leaving space to transport stuff above the purple laser.

      <li>
        Move the other three blocks and the top-left to bottom-right mirror on
        the blue and yellow tiles in the bottom-right room.

        Move the last mirror to reflect the purple mirror to the right and into
        the mirror placed to block the green laser, reflecting into the purple
        receptacle.
