    <div>The feeders to this sequence metapuzzle:</div>
    <ul className="list list-inside">
      <li>INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE</li>
      <li>SPRING</li>
      <li>SUNDAY</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      The diagram on the CD describes the path of the laser as time passes,
      which is also known as an Archimedean spiral. Notably, each feeder has a
      corresponding length of time (we define spring as having 92 days).
      Converting each time length into a path length of the laser, we can
      calculate the final position of the laser dot.
    </div>
    <div>
      There are several approaches that can be taken to find the position after
      travelling a given distance. The first, and most painful, way is to use
      the exact polar-coordinate path-length integral, plot it as a function of
      time, and find the point that this curve intersects the y=L line.
    </div>
    <div>
      Alternatively, we can approximate the spiral as a sequence of circles that
      increase in diameter. In order for this approximation to be accurate
      enough, though, we need to use the average radius of each circle, so the
      first radius is 25 mm + 0.8 Âµm, and each successive radius increases by
      1.6 Âµm. This simple approximation stays within 0.000025 radians of the
      exact answer!
    </div>
    <div>
      Finally, there are, apparently, tools online that will tell you how many
      revolutions are taken before a certain path length is reached for a given
      parametrization of an Archimedean spiral.
