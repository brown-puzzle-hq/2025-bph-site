    In this puzzle, six gears (each with six teeth) are arranged in a circle. Interestingly enough, three of the gears contain words on the teeth, written counterclockwise: EERIER, HOISTS, and CARDIA.
  </div>
  <div>
    One of the gears is shown to be turning in a specific direction (clockwise). Because of how gears work, when that gear turns, then gears which are an odd distance away turn in the opposite direction, and gears which are an even distance away turn in the same direction.
  </div>
  <div>
    If we notice that the two feeder answers in this sequence are all six letter words, then we might realize that we can place the answers onto the blank gears. Specifically, we can place them onto the gears such that, as the gears spin around, each of the highlighted teeth could spell another six letter word. Using this, we can work out what 6-letter word can go on the remaining unfilled gear:
  </div>
  <div className="mb-6">
    The word BANNER goes on the fifth gear clockwise, with the B highlighted. The word JUNGLE goes on the fourth gear clockwise, with the E highlighted. This spells the following words:
