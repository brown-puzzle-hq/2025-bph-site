    The goal of this puzzle is to identify the names of the chess positions, which are different openings. The lines between the positions and the number indicate the number of moves (from white or black) it takes to go from one board state to the other. No number indicates one move.
  </p>

  <p className="space-y-4">The names of the positions with indices are (top to bottom):</p>
  
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
    <li>Nescafe Frappe Attack <span className="font-semibold">[12]</span></li>
    <li>Maccutcheon Variation <span className="font-semibold">[2]</span></li>
    <li>Winawer Variation <span className="font-semibold">[1]</span></li>
    <li>Bongcloud Attack <span className="font-semibold">[3]</span></li>
    <li>Trompowsky Attack <span className="font-semibold">[1]</span></li>
    <li>Petrov Defence <span className="font-semibold">[5]</span></li>
    <li>Fingerslip Variation <span className="font-semibold">[1]</span></li>
    <li>4 Knights Attack <span className="font-semibold">[1]</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Taking indices one obtains <span className="font-bold text-blue-400">PAWNTOF4</span> (4). This move gives rise to the Bird’s Opening. Since the answer is 4 letters, we get 
    <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> BIRD</span>.
  </p>

  <p className="italic text-gray-500">
    NOTE: The last opening could alternatively be “Four Knights Attack,” which gives an F during indexing, but PAWNTOFF doesn’t make sense, so the puzzle solver is expected to realize you are supposed to index the number 4 instead.
