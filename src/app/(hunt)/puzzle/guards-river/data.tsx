        You are traveling with two guards, two doors, and a cabbage. You arrive

        There is a wolf guard and a goat guard. The guards are
        indistinguishable. There are two doors: one will let you through to
        [Drama], and the other will end your puzzlehunt journey. The doors are
        also indistinguishable. If you leave the wolf guard with the correct
        door unattended, the wolf will eat it. If you leave the goat guard with
        the incorrect door, the goat will eat it as well. If you leave the wolf
        guard with the goat guard, the wolf will eat the goat. If you leave the
        goat guard with the cabbage, the goat guard will eat the cabbage. If you
        bring the cabbage on the boat, the cabbage will eat the boat, and you
        will drown (no one can swim) ðŸ’€.
