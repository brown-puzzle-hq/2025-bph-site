Going through your door will lead to the next area of the puzzle hunt, but if any guard attempts to go through a door that has a window, a hungry pigeon behind it will eat the door first, preventing them from progressing. However, if a door does not have a window, the guard can go through the door before the pigeon has a chance to eat it. Other guards are all perfect logicians and will go through their doors if and only if they believe they are 100% certain it is windowless. However, unbeknownst to them, every guard other than you is hallucinating, and never sees another guard move, even when they do moveâ€¦</div>
