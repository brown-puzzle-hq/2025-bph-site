        ‚ÄúUpon observation, when viewing it all,

        This clues to the puzzle ‚ÄúOne Guard, Two Doors, and a Screen.‚Äù The Guard
        asks how many are spotted on the wall when viewing the entire puzzle
        (i.e. the entire puzzle is in the user‚Äôs window), which is two, because
        the guard can only hit two points on the wall when the entire puzzle is
        in frame.
      </p>
      <li className="mb-4 ml-8">
        ‚ÄúOnce the second one comes near, and if truth is all you hear,

        asks what your chance of getting correct information is in the second
        puzzle if both announcers are telling the truth, which is 100%. Thus,
        because 100% \= 1, the number for this clue is 1.
      </p>
      <li className="mb-4 ml-8">
        ‚ÄúIn the past few moves, I need not see a thing,

      <p className="mb-4">
        This clues to the puzzle ‚ÄúTwo Guards, Two Doors, A Boat, A River, and A
        Cabbage.‚Äù The Guard asks for what move you are on if all of your
        previous moves could be preset but your current move would require
        observation of an event happening or not happening. Playing the puzzle
        optimally, this is your fourth move, when you must observe whether the
        guard on the other side of the river eats the cabbage or not.

      <p className="mb-4">
        This clues to the puzzle ‚ÄúTen Guards, Ten Doors.‚Äù The Guard asks for the
        day four days before the day you go through your door, which is on the
        sixth day. Thus, The Guard is referring to the second day.

      <li className="mb-4 ml-8">
